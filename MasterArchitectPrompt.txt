I am building an Interactive PDF Extraction Tool using a Spec-Driven Approach.


Please read the following three files:


@requirements.md
@plan.md
@tasks.md

Your Role: Act as a Senior Full-Stack Developer.


Current Objective: Start with Phase 0 and Phase 1.


Initialize a Git repository with a monorepo structure (/frontend and /backend).
Create the .gitignore and README.md.
Scaffold the FastAPI backend and React frontend.
Implement Task B1 (PDF indexing with PyMuPDF).

Technical Requirements:


Use Vite for the React frontend.
Use instructor for LLM calls.
Use pydantic.create_model for dynamic schemas.
Git Strategy: After completing each major task (e.g., G1-G3, B1), please suggest a clear commit message.

Please confirm you have read the files and are ready to initialize the repository.
